# ipcamkiller
A script to end IoT. Written by Cinaed666

This script exploits a weakness in the jaws/1.0 framework
This weakness allows it to perform shell commands from the url without the need to sign in.
The jaws framework is readily used by ip cams 
With this script we shut down these Ipcams.

Usage:
- Get yourself a csv file from shodan with jaws/1.0 Ipcams (you will need to pay to get this file).
- name the csv file shodan_data.csv
- Put the csv file in the same directory as the script.
- make the script executible.
- run the script.
